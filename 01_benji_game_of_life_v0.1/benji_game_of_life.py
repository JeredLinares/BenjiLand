# Created with love for my son 
# To inspire his curiosity

# The hardware is two buttons and a 5x5 LED matrix 
# One button iterates starting frames from 1-17, then randomly assigned
# The second button steps though frames based on the starting frame
# This is made in the style of a toddler's wooden block toy


import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Initalize a global 5x5x17 matrix which will hold the starting conditions

# Initalize a counter to follow current initall frame

# Read starting frames file and set values in starting frames matrix

# Function to Iterate to next frame
# Due to 5x5 constraint due to limited GPIO pins on Rasberry pi, act as if continous column 0 to column 4 and row 0 to row 4 (
